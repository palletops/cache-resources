# cache-resources

A Clojure library to provide caching for resources that need closing.

Caches are immutable and implement Clojure's map interfaces for lookup
in the cache (and adding/removing items to/from the cache).

The elements in the cache can be inspected using `seq` and counted
with `count`.  The queue can be emptied by calling `empty`.

The library provides an underlying CacheImplProtocol to provide a
framework for implementing caches, similar to [core.cache].

## Installation

Add the library to your dependencies:

```clj
:dependencies [[com.palletops/cache-resources "0.1.0"]]
```

## Usage

The library currently only provides a FIFO cache.  Use the `:evict-f`
option key to specify a function of a single argument that will be
called on each value that leaves the cache.

The `:evict-f` function is not called if you `release` an item from
the cache.

Note that `:evict-f` is a side effect on a immutable datastructure,
which means that you should forget the old value of the cache when
inserting items into the cache.

The `:threshold` option key is used to specify the size of the cache
(defaults to 32).

```clj
(require '[com.palletops.cache-resources :refer [fifo-cache-factory]])
(let [cache (fifo-cache-factory
               (sorted-map :a 1, :b 2)
               {:threshold 3 :evict-f #(println % "removed")})
        b (assoc cache :c 3)]
    (let [c (assoc b :d 4)]
      (dissoc c :d)))
```
